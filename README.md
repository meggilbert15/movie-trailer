# UHF

## Description


When a desperate UHF Channel 62 station gives the seriously odd George the job of manager, he and his best friend Bob prove to be programming geniuses, turning the station around -- and attracting the attention of an unscrupulous competitor. This comedy focuses most of its creative attention on numerous bizarre television parodies featured throughout/.

## Revisions

I made the background more dynamic by adding movement and more colors. This improvement helped to make my art direction more clear and cohesive with the plot of the movie. I also improved the responsivity of the website across multiple devices, making the site more accessible and an overall better experience. In the future, I would like to add more sections to the site and maybe outline the movie info section to be more interactive.
